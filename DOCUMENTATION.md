### General Purpose

The **FailsafeOTA** library is designed to enhance the robustness and reliability of systems by managing critical operational aspects such as logging, Wi-Fi configuration, and remote access, especially in scenarios where exceptions or failures may occur. It ensures that after multiple system exceptions, safe and reliable remote access remains possible to address issues without physical intervention.

Key functions of the library include:
- **Logging control:** Captures and manages logs for monitoring system performance and diagnosing issues.
- **Wi-Fi management:** Handles Wi-Fi parameters and connection status, allowing the system to reconfigure or reconnect as needed.
- **Failsafe mechanisms:** Provides an automated recovery path in case of multiple exceptions, ensuring remote access is maintained for troubleshooting and updates.

This library is particularly useful for embedded systems or IoT devices where maintaining a stable connection and monitoring remote performance are crucial, even in failure scenarios.


### Overall Architecture

The **FailsafeOTA** library is built around a modular architecture, ensuring that key functionalities like logging, Wi-Fi management, and remote access control are well-separated and maintainable. This design allows for flexibility in how the library can be integrated and extended within embedded systems or IoT devices.

#### Key Components

1. **OSIExceptionCount**: Tracks the number of system exceptions and triggers recovery after multiple failures.
2. **OSIFileManager**: Manages file operations like reading and writing to store system logs or configurations.
3. **OSIMaintenanceMode**: Manages the system's safe mode for recovery, including Wi-Fi handling.
4. **OSIReverseDNS**: Handles reverse DNS lookups to assist with network configuration validation.
5. **OSIWiFiCredentials**: Stores and manages Wi-Fi credentials for connection purposes.
6. **OSIWifiHandler**: Handles Wi-Fi connectivity, reconnections, and disconnections.

#### Design Patterns

- **Singleton Pattern**: The `OSIWiFiHandler` and `OSIFileManager` classes are structured to ensure single instances manage file and Wi-Fi operations.
- **Observer Pattern**: `OSIExceptionCount` monitors exceptions and notifies the system when recovery actions are needed.
- **State Pattern**: `OSIWiFiHandler` operates with states like **connected**, **disconnected**, and **reconnecting**.
- **Strategy Pattern**: `OSIMaintenanceModeBestWifi` allows for selecting the most reliable Wi-Fi network during recovery.

These design patterns ensure the system is modular, robust, and flexible in handling failures.

### Overall Program Structure and Code Structure

The **FailsafeOTA** library is structured in a way that separates its core functionalities (such as exception handling, file management, Wi-Fi management, and maintenance modes) into individual components. This modular design promotes maintainability, scalability, and ease of use.

#### Modularity and Extensibility

The modular nature of the **FailsafeOTA** library allows developers to extend or modify individual components, such as adding new Wi-Fi management strategies or enhancing logging functionality, without affecting the rest of the system. Each class handles a specific responsibility, promoting separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.


#### Code Design

Each module is designed to follow a single responsibility principle, which ensures that each file or class has one primary role. This modularity promotes clean code, better testability, and easier debugging.

- **Class-based design:** The library is object-oriented, where each module (e.g., **Wi-Fi Manager**, **Failsafe Mechanism**) is implemented as a class. This enables encapsulation and clear abstraction of functionalities.
  
- **Configuration management:** Parameters for Wi-Fi configuration, logging levels, and remote access methods are stored in separate config files or passed as arguments, allowing the system to be easily reconfigured without modifying the core codebase.

- **Error handling and recovery:** The code implements robust error handling in each module, ensuring that failures are logged and recovery actions are initiated automatically. Exception handling is a critical part of the fail-safe mechanism.

- **Code reuse:** By dividing the system into well-defined components, the library ensures that common tasks (e.g., logging, status checks) are reusable across multiple parts of the system. This minimizes redundancy and improves the overall efficiency of the code.

Overall, the **FailsafeOTA** library follows a clean and organized structure that promotes flexibility and ease of integration, while ensuring the system's resilience in handli
